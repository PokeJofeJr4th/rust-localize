# Localize

This crate aims to create a runtime-efficient framework for localizing static strings.

## Structure

The main crate, `localize`, is at the root of the repository. It contains all of the runtime behavior of the `LocalizationTable` and `LocaleHandle` types. The `localization_table!` macro is contained in the `localize_macros` folder.
